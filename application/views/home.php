<p>Recently I was invited for an interview and technical test for a job I had applied for as a Web Developer. I had no idea what the technical test would involve,
 but on arrival I was asked to build a simple database application. This project is my implementation
  of the task, completed after the interview using the Codeigniter MVC framework.</p>
